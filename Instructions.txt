There are multiple documents being provided to you as dataset in document_set folder inside test packet.

Your objective is to classify documents into a category.

For example if two document are talking about same topic they are classified under same category.
In the same manner a training data set is provided to you in the test packet under training_data folder which consists of a csv file with 2 columns 

Document_ID , Label
Document_0,     0
Document_1,     0
Document_2,     1

Where same label for multiple documents mean they below to same category.

You have to write a machine learning algorithm that learns how to classify documents into different categories 
and predict the category for the documents list provided as csv file under "test_data" folder

Your Submission should have to be inside "evaluation_file" folder in csv format with file name "predicted_cat.csv" , a sample version has been provided for your reference.

Your solution will be evaluated with Metric ROC Area under curve for multiclass classification

Steps for Submission of Solutions:

1.Download the test packet zip file from here.
2.Store you Machine Learning code inside the "code" folder
3.Run your model on test data and store it under evaluation_file folder with "predicted_cat.csv" name
4.Make sure your evaluation file has the same structure as the sample evaluation file provided
5.Click on attach  file button in the editor to upload the zip file named ML_Solution which will contain two folders namely code and evaluation_file.
(Note : Do not include any other folder as it will increase the size and will take time for upload to be succesful)
